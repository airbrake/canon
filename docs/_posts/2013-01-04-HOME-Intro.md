Canon was built to make application development easier and faster.

1. Rackspace customers gain a consistent, fanatical experience using our products.
2. Your team doesn't have to spend time designing interfaces that have already been researched and tested at Rackspace.
3. Canon [front-end experts](https://one.rackspace.com/display/RED/Canon) tackle browser testing, release planning and backwards compatibility.
