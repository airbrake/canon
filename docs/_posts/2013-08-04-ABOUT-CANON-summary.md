The goal of Canon is to lower the barrier of entry for new UIs at Rackspace. Inspired by Twitter Bootstrap, Canon is created for *and* by designers and developers. It already serves as the unified library for control panels like Reach, MyRack, Cloud Backup, Cloud Control and others. Canon is a standardized front-end framework consisting of HTML, CSS, JS and UX library of elements and patterns. These patterns have been designed, tested and approved by the Product Design group in Rackspace Experience Design. They will evolve over time and need contributors like you.
