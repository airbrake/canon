The goal of Canon is to lower the barrier of entry for new UIs at Rackspace. 

Inspired by Twitter Bootstrap, Canon is created by *and* for designers and developers at Rackspace. It already serves as the unified library for control panels like <a href="">MyCloud</a>, <a href="">MyRackspace</a>, <a href="">Cloud Backup</a>, <a href="">MailGun</a> and others. 

Canon is a front-end framework of HTML and CSS.  The UI Components and Layouts in Canon have been designed and tested by Rackspace Product Design and are combined to form a UX Pattern Library.
