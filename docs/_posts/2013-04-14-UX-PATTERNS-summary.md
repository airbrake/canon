	<p>UX Patterns consist of <a href="/ui-components/">UI Components</a> that have been arranged and combined into templatized views. Our patterns and widgets have been tested and tweaked for optimal usability and to meet user needs. Please <a href="mailto:canon@lists.rackspace.com">contact us</a> if we are missing something your users need.</p>
    <h3>How do I use UX patterns?</h3>
    <p>These patterns accellerate the design and development processes by serving as a UI framework for most interactions in an application. Different roles benefit in different ways:</p>
	    <ul>
	    	<li><strong>UX Designers</strong> use patterns to ensure consistency and accellerate decision making when designing application workflows.</li>
		    <li><strong>Interaction Designers</strong> can grab markup from patterns to facilitate rapid prototyping.</li>
		    <li><strong>Front-End Developers</strong> can reference components that make up each pattern and know exactly what is needed to build views.</li>
		    <li><strong>Back-End Developers</strong> can reference UX patterns to help inform the construction of backend logic based on standard workflows.</li>
	  	</ul>
